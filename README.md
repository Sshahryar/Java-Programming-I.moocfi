# JavaProgrammingI_mooc.fi

Repository where I will be uploading my submissions for exercises from the "Java Programming I" course from the University of Helsinki.

The exercises were submitted using the TMC (test my code) plugin from the Univerity of Helsinki using Intellij, the submissions stored here for keepsake. 

They are placed in a folder based on the part of the course they were from.

For example the submissions for part 1 will be in "Part1ExerciseSubmission", below will be the parts of the courses with the exercise, their submissions all in order and plenty of other information.
